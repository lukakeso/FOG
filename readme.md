# FOG Computing Project

Welcome!

This repo was made as part of FOG Computing course lead by prof. dr. Vlado Stankovski.

We are managing our experiments using [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/).

We are wrapping our prediction system in a frontend written in Python using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/docs).
